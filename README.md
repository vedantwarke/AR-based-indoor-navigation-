# AR-based-indoor-navigation-
This project introduces an advanced Indoor Navigation System for our college. LiDAR sensors create detailed 3D maps, crucial for accurate positioning. The user-friendly application provides intuitive navigation with step-by-step directions and real-time route optimization, catering to students, faculty, and visitors.

Sorry couldnt upload the source file for this project as the unity file exceeds the size limit.
